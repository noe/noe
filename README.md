I do both Pytorch and Tensorflow/Keras. Lately, I have been doing integrations with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.
- **Data science**: experience with the Python stack: scikit-learn, pandas, etc. I deal with SQL every day. Regarding algorithms: experience with logistic regression, SVMs, linear regression, Bayesian linear models, A/B testing, gradient-boosted trees, k-means, hdbscan.
