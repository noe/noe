Hi, I'm Noe Casas. I specialize in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI).

I work at Apple, as a machine learning engineer in Siri.


Areas of expertise:
- **Machine translation, language modelling and NLP**: I hold a PhD in Neural Machine Translation and have been doing NLP (deep learning-based and _classical_) for the last 8 years, both in Python and C++; I also have experience in speech processing and computer vision. I am experienced in both Pytorch and Tensorflow.
- **Data science**: experience with the Python stack: scikit-learn, pandas, etc. I deal with SQL every day. Regarding algorithms: experience with logistic regression, SVMs, linear regression, Bayesian linear models, A/B testing, gradient-boosted trees, k-means, hdbscan.
- **Software development**: almost 20 years of professional programming experience. Extensive backend experience in Python, Javascript, C++, and Java; experience also in mobile development in Kotlin and Swift, and some web development with React. 
- **Systems engineering**: experience building scalable internet-facing services based on node.js/python, nginx, redis and SQL databases.


I am the creator of a language learning app called **Langtern**. Find out more at www.langtern.com
